    #LOC_BET_probeCoreSphere_description = The Stayputnik offers the most basic control for a craft. A lightweight sphere equipped with remote receivers and relay control input from the ground to the craft, it carries no crew at all, thus keeping them perfectly safe from all harm. This device does require electricity to operate however, and will cease to function if the power runs out. The built-in batteries should keep it going for about a couple of minutes. It's, indeed, more of a battery than a probe.
    #LOC_BET_rt1_description = The RT-1 is the smallest SRB on the market. It was discovered by accident, while one of our engineers filled a pepper shaker with rocket fuel. However, while this little rocket lacks of the power to drive things to space, it's a good way to send small probes far away from the space center. Our weather scientists loves it!
